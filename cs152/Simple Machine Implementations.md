## ISA's
* Contract b/w software and hardware
* Typically described by giving all the programmer-visible state plus the semantics of the instructions that operate on the site
* IBM 360 was the first line of machines separating ISA from implementation
* Thus, there are many implementations for one ISA:
	* Soviets built code-compatible clones of IBM360, as did Amdahl after leaving IBM
	* AMD, Intel, VIA processors run AMD64 ISA
	* Many cell phones use ARM ISA w/ implementations differing among many companies
* In this class, we will use RISC-V ISA.
