## Themes to Watch out For
* Core operations / Turing completeness
	* Dynamic Branching
	* Data-dependent Memory Addressing
	* Arithmetic
* Stored program / Universal Turing Machine
	* Program and data are same thing
## Old Ideas
* Difference Engine (1822)
	* Continuous func's can be approximated by polynomials
	* So, can calculate only with a single adder
	* Probably the first algorithm-hardware co-design
* Analytical Engine (1837)
	* Recognized as first general-purpose digital computer
	* Contains the major components of modern computers
		* "Store": Main memory where numbers and independent results were held (1,000 decimal words, 40 digits each)
		* "Mill": Arithmetic unit where processing was performed including addition, multiplication, division
	* I/O on punch cards
	* Only small pieces were ever built
	* Design choices
		* Decimal, as storage was on gears
		* 40-digit precision
		* Used locking to overcome noise
		* Had a fast "anticipating" carry
			* Mechanical ver. of pass-transistor carry propagate used in CMOS adders.
* Zuse Z3 (1941)
	* 
* ENIAC (1946)
	* 17,468 vacuum tubes
	* Weighed 30T, occupied 1800 sqft, power 150kW
	* Had a conditional branch!
	* Entirely I/O-bound.
	* However
		* Slow to reprogram, often broken.
* EDVAC
	* ENIAC team started discussion stored-program concept to speed up programming and simplify machine design
	* In 1948, modifications to ENIAC allowed it to run in stored-program mode but it was 6x slower than hardwired.
